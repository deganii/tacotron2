/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0351.wav|to think about the carbonyl chemistry you've
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0079.wav|So what I want to do now is show you
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0309.wav|is same with FMN and FAD.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0311.wav|And it gets oxidized to form pyruvate.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0013.wav|I like Flintstones vitamins because you
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0287.wav|you always have to think about the proton.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0402.wav|to generate lactic acid.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0485.wav|going to encounter over and over again during your journey
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0228.wav|do hydride transfer.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0161.wav|and you think about the ion 3 state going to the ion 2 state.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0083.wav|And that's the reduced form, versus FAD or FMN.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0488.wav|about the chemistry of how these two cofactors work
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0464.wav|This is a position, if you look at this,
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0110.wav|So the business end of the molecule is indicated here.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0149.wav|does 2 electron chemistry all of the time.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0152.wav|And in fact, function of flavins inside the cell
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0016.wav|And today what I'm going to start talking about
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0463.wav|why doesn't that hydride get transferred to this position?
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0109.wav|we're going to call R, is not involved in the chemistry.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0346.wav|So what I want to do now is very briefly then
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0139.wav|So what I want to do is compare the properties of these two
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0237.wav|So you can do N5 chemistry by hydride transfer.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0260.wav|And we need to be able to recycle and keep.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0352.wav|been introduced to when talking about the claisen reaction
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0317.wav|So NAD/NADH is always in this region.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0393.wav|And so likely then in the active site of the enzyme
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0248.wav|breakdown of sugar under anaerobic conditions.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0379.wav|And why aren't they equivalent?
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0019.wav|And what we will focus on today is
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0296.wav|that flavins can also catalyze the same type of reaction.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0269.wav|generated during glycolosis, plus the molecule called
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0226.wav|With FAD/FADH2 the chemistry is considerably more complicated.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0377.wav|is the 1, 2, 3, 4 position of the nicotinamide ring are not
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0003.wav|continue to offer high quality educational resources for free.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0343.wav|convert pyruvate into a molecule called acid aldehyde.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0125.wav|And so this is the N1 position, this is 2, 3, 4.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0280.wav|is going to get transferred to the carbon of the carbonyl.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0286.wav|to make them favorable, is that with NAD/NADH cofactor,
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0077.wav|we're going to be focusing on.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0184.wav|have anything designed into the structure where they
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0375.wav|is something you will hear about over and over again
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0468.wav|And you need to know that you don't
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0275.wav|And NADH is going to reduce this ketone to an alcohol.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0294.wav|a proton with NAD/NADH systems.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0429.wav|NADH, sorry.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0182.wav|homologous to each other.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0440.wav|So you have hydride transfer to the N5 position.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0080.wav|how this compares to the second form of the organic cofactor
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0307.wav|So this is the form of the cofactor that's
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0258.wav|trapped to make the energy currency of the cell, ATP.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0011.wav|And they're all found on your vitamin bottle.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0365.wav|and likes to can accommodate electrons in its orbitals.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0086.wav|And you'll see that it has a very complex ring
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0266.wav|So what happens at the ending, one anaerobic ending
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0036.wav|in the reduced state.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0471.wav|And this is a complex heterocyclical molecule
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0058.wav|And I'm just going to abbreviate the adenosine part
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0041.wav|have to be converted inside the cell
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0270.wav|pyruvate.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0050.wav|And that you will be given the structures whenever
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0209.wav|tightly bound or covalently bound to the substrate.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0390.wav|that's a hydride, to this carbon of the carbonyl.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0426.wav|And remember I told you the business end of the molecule
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0409.wav|one of the many types of reactions
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0123.wav|positions are.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0222.wav|this is probably the simplest.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0062.wav|the R group, because it's not involved in the chemistry.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0434.wav|happen with the flavin?
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0130.wav|in the overall chemistry of the transformation.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0187.wav|regardless of what enzyme time it's bound to.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0023.wav|in these transformations in all primary metabolic pathways.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0043.wav|So if you look at NADH-- let me draw that structure for you,
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0000.wav|SPEAKER 1: The following content is provided under a Creative
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0201.wav|That is, NAD/NADH is any D, for example
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0368.wav|at the carbon.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0419.wav|And so what I want to do now is show you the chemistry
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0098.wav|This is the reduced form.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0349.wav|and the mechanism, let's start with pyruvate.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0304.wav|an equilibrium reaction where you take lactate-- so this
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0478.wav|And so I'm telling you what the answer is.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0178.wav|It turns out that if you look at the hundreds
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0369.wav|And so we want to reduce this carbonyl to an alcohol.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0256.wav|into water, which is really releases
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0094.wav|and how we know that in a few minutes.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0457.wav|about how you wanted to take advantage of the fact
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0095.wav|So attached to this nitrogen is more complex
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0435.wav|And the chemistry happens at stereo specifically.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0169.wav|the easier it is to reduce.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0069.wav|you need to know what the oxidized form is.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0305.wav|is now the reduced state.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0048.wav|And you don't have to memorize the structures of any
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0341.wav|all the way down under anaerobic conditions into ethanol,
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0373.wav|And so now the question is, how does this chemistry happen?
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0207.wav|So they dissociate in every single turn over.
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0279.wav|this hydrogen from the NAD as a hydride
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0227.wav|But what I will show you is that it can also
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0148.wav|And what we will see is NAD/NADH always
/home/ubuntu/OCW_0.1/wavs/07SCF13-JS-0143.wav|and the other side will have FAD, again, the oxidized form,
